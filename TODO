Here are some features that could enhance your CLI tool:
Dependency Management

Automatically detect and list dependencies for each component (both npm packages and internal dependencies)
Resolve dependency conflicts when importing multiple components
Generate installation commands for missing dependencies

Component Validation

Validate component structure and required files before export
Check for broken imports/references
Lint components against configurable style guides
Verify component props and TypeScript interfaces

Version Control & Updates

Track component versions and changelog
Update notifications when newer versions are available
Diff tool to show changes between component versions
Rollback capabilities

Enhanced Discovery

Search components by tags, categories, or keywords
Preview components with screenshots or code snippets
Show usage examples and documentation
Rate/review system for shared components

Workspace Integration

Batch operations (export/import multiple components)
Integration with existing build tools (webpack, vite, etc.)
Git hooks for automatic exports on commits
Watch mode for real-time syncing

Configuration & Templates

Component scaffolding/templates for different patterns
Customizable export formats beyond TOML
Project-specific configuration profiles
Transform components between different frameworks (React ‚Üí Vue, etc.)

Registry Features

Remote component registry/marketplace
Team/organization component sharing
Access control and permissions
Component analytics and usage tracking

Which of these align with your vision for the tool?





=====================
That‚Äôs a solid start. Here are some practical and advanced features you can consider to make your CLI tool more robust, ergonomic, and team-friendly:
üîß Core Usability Features
1. Dependency Resolution

Automatically detect and warn (or optionally install) missing npm packages that the imported component relies on, based on the package.json diff or a declared dependencies block in the TOML.
2. Component Preview (Optional GUI or CLI snapshot)

Allow users to preview components (e.g., via a terminal screenshot using dom-to-image + ascii art or an actual mini web preview server).
3. Conflict Resolution

Detect name/file collisions during import and provide options:

    Overwrite

    Rename

    Skip

    Side-by-side diff view (for VCS-style merging)

4. Interactive Mode

Allow the import/export process to optionally be interactive (pick specific props, subcomponents, etc.).
üì¶ Component Metadata
5. Tagging & Categorization

Allow tagging of components (#form, #input, #modal) in the TOML and support searching/filtering on import.
6. Semantic Versioning

Track changes to components using semver. Enable pinning or upgrading of versions when importing.
7. Author & Source Info

Embed author, created_at, and optionally a source_url (if exported from a repo) in the TOML for auditing.
üîç Discovery & Search
8. Searchable Registry

Maintain an index or registry file (maybe .component-index.toml) where all exported components are listed. Allow searching:

cli-tool search modal --tag=ui --tech=svelte

9. Preview Descriptions

Support short Markdown descriptions per component (inside TOML or alongside in .md) that get shown on listing.
üõ† Developer Experience
10. Custom Hooks

Support optional pre- and post-import/export hooks (like modifying names, changing paths, running formatters).
11. Template Injection

Allow optional customization or injection during import (e.g., inject additional props, wrap in ErrorBoundary, etc.).
12. Tech Stack Compatibility Map

Support mapping/translation between slightly differing stacks (e.g., Vue 2 vs Vue 3 or different Svelte versions) via rules or transform scripts.
üîÑ Sync & Automation
13. Remote Component Store Integration

Allow pushing/pulling from remote component stores (Git repo, S3, or a central registry). Auth support included.
14. Bulk Export/Import

Support batch operations:

cli-tool export --all
cli-tool import --from ./archive.zip

15. Format Conversion

Support exporting/importing to other formats too (YAML, JSON, or just zipped .js/.ts/.svelte files).
üîí Security & Validation
16. Static Analysis on Import

Warn if the component contains risky patterns (e.g., eval, insecure refs, etc.).
17. Schema Validation

Enforce a strict TOML schema (or support JSON Schema equivalent validation), and validate before import.

Let me know your stack (e.g., is it mostly for Svelte, React, or mixed?) and team size ‚Äî I can tailor suggestions more precisely.
